# My Problem

I use a component which is  dragSource of react-dnd for TreeNode title.

This works finely in antd 3.1.3, but broken in 3.6.1

The Procedures:

Step1: `npm start`

Step2: Drag tree node from left to right.

Step3: If the text in right block changed to "can drop", it means react-dnd works.
